/* ========== DARK THEME STYLES ========== */

/* This file contains dark theme overrides that apply globally.
   Component-specific dark theme styles are in their respective component CSS files,
   applied when the .dark-mode class is present on the root element. */

/* The .dark-mode class itself is defined in base.css */

/* No additional styling needed here as all dark mode styles are defined 
   in base.css and component-specific stylesheets with .dark-mode selectors */
